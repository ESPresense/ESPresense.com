An ESP32-based presence detection node designed for localized device tracking.

Reasons to use this over other solutions:

* ESP32 nodes are cheaper and easier to use than Raspberry Pis
* Extensive fingerprint-based IDs instead of MAC addresses for tracking or counting devices others can't
* IRK-based enrollment of Apple devices to passively locate them uniquely, even with private random addresses
* Home Assistant MQTT Discovery for easy HA configuration
* Auto-updates by downloading GitHub-released binaries (optional, with a preference to disable if desired)
* Filters measured distance with both a median pre-filter and a 1Euro filter (reduces jitter for greater accuracy)

## Ways to Use ESPresense

ESPresense supports two fundamentally different approaches. Choosing the right one upfront will save you confusion and hardware costs.

### Which Should I Choose?

**Choose [mqtt_room](/approaches#approach-1-mqtt_room-simple-room-presence) if:**

- You want simple room-based automations
- You have 1 node per room
- You don't need a floor plan

**Choose [Companion](/approaches#approach-2-companion-precise-positioning) if:**

- You need precise X,Y coordinates
- You can deploy 5-8+ nodes per floor
- You have/want a floor plan

:::note
These are fundamentally different approaches. mqtt_room uses 1 node per room. Companion needs dense coverage (5-8 per floor) with strategic placement. More nodes doesn't make mqtt_room better - pick one approach and commit.

## Requirements

* One or more ESP [Nodes](/nodes), depending on your approach
* A [Trackable Device](/devices), such as a supported beacons, phone or watch
* A [MQTT Server](https://mosquitto.org/)

## Configuration & Setup

* [Network Configuration](/configuration/network) - WiFi and MQTT setup
* [Hardware Support](/configuration/hardware) - LEDs, Motion, and Environmental sensors
* [Advanced Settings](/configuration/settings) - Filtering, Counting, and Scanning logic
* [MQTT Settings](/configuration/mqtt) - Configure via MQTT

## Integrations

Connect ESPresense to your favorite automation platform:
* [Home Assistant](/integrations/home-assistant)
* [Homebridge](/integrations/homebridge)
* [Domoticz](/integrations/domoticz)
