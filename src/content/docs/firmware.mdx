## Browser-Based Installer

Begin by connecting an ESP device to your computer using USB, then click the "Connect" button below:

<FirmwareInstaller />

## Post-Flashing Steps

Upon successful firmware flashing, search for an Access Point (AP) with an SSID beginning with "ESPresense-". Connect to this network to access the configuration portal. For setup instructions, visit [Configuration Settings](/configuration/settings).

## Firmware MQTT behavior (what firmware reads/writes)

After Wi-Fi setup, each ESPresense node uses MQTT in two directions:

### Firmware writes (publishes)
- `espresense/rooms/<room>/status` (online/offline availability)
- `espresense/rooms/<room>/telemetry` (node health/config telemetry)
- `espresense/devices/<device_id>` (detected BLE device updates)

### Firmware reads (subscribes)
- `espresense/rooms/<room>/+/set` (per-node setting updates)
- `espresense/rooms/*/+/set` (fleet-wide setting updates)

This is how nodes receive runtime config like `max_distance`, `include/exclude`, `auto_update`, and LED commands.

For the full command/config topic reference and examples, see [MQTT](/configuration/mqtt).

## Alpha / Nightly Builds

For those interested in experimental features, you can opt for a nightly/alpha build available [here](/alpha). Please note this is for adventurous users and may not be stable.
