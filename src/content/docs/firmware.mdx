## Browser-Based Installer

:::note[Browser requirement]
The web flasher uses **WebSerial**, which currently works in **Google Chrome** and **Microsoft Edge** on desktop. If the install button does not work, switch to Chrome/Edge and try again.

Begin by connecting an ESP device to your computer using USB, then click the "Connect" button below:

<FirmwareInstaller />

## Post-Flashing Steps

Upon successful firmware flashing, search for an Access Point (AP) with an SSID beginning with "ESPresense-". Connect to this network to access the configuration portal. For setup instructions, visit [Configuration Settings](/configuration/settings).

## Alpha / Nightly Builds

For those interested in experimental features, you can opt for a nightly/alpha build available [here](/alpha). Please note this is for adventurous users and may not be stable.
